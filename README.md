# Koromo Copy Project

`Koromo Copy` is a program that helps you extract texts, images and videos from many web sites, and manage downloaded contents.
This program supports `Linux`, `Windows`, and `Mac OS X` operating systems, and can be used for `Server` as well as `User Level GUI Programs`.

## Structure

`frontend` => `nodejs(electronjs + reactjs)`

`backend` => `c# with javascript`

The `c#` is responsible for download, file management and communication with `frontend`.
Most things related to `crawling, processing, saving` will be implemented using `javascript`.

The `frontend` is just a `User Level GUI tool` for managing the `backend`.
You can also link with external networks through some settings.

## Make your own crawler using Koromo Copy!!

`Koromo Copy` provides a tool called `Custom Crawler` to implement `crawler` very easily.
Unfortunately, this tool is currently only supported on `Windows`.

### What is `Custom Crawler`?

`Custom Crawler` is `static` web analysis tools for `Koromo Copy Project`.
With this tool, you can write crawlers many times more efficiently than using other browsers.

Currently, the `static` web analyzer is almost complete, and we are preparing to build a `dynamic` web analyzer.
